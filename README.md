# Front_CSEH - React + Vite

This project is a web application built with **React** and **Vite**. It features a minimal setup to leverage the power of Vite's fast development server, HMR (Hot Module Replacement), and efficient build process, alongside Reactâ€™s modern front-end capabilities.

## Features

- **React** 18.3.1 with functional components, hooks, and efficient rendering.
- **Vite** as the build tool for fast development and optimized production builds.
- **React Router Dom** 6.26.2 for client-side routing.
- **ESLint** for code quality and consistency with React-specific rules.
- **React Icons** for scalable icons, and **React Responsive** for responsive design capabilities.
- Fast Refresh using [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react).
- **React Scroll** for smooth scrolling between sections.
- **Redux** for state management, enabling efficient data handling and scalability.
- **Axios** for managing API requests, handling authentication, and connecting with backend services.
- **Context API** to pass data through components, improving the management of global state across the application.
